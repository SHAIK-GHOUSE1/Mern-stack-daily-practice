    <h1>Data Science</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><i>From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</i></p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Data science</b> is the study of the extraction of knowledge from data. It uses techniques from many fields, including signal processing, mathematics, probability, machine learning, computer programming, statistics, data engineering, pattern matching, and <mark> visualization, with the goal of extracting useful knowledge</mark> from the data. With computer systems able to handle more data, big data is an important aspect of data science.</p>
    <p>A person that does data science is called a data scientist.<sup>[1]</sup> Data scientists solve complicated data problems using mathematics, statistics and computer science.[2] However, a data scientist is most likely to be an expert in only one or two of these disciplines, meaning that cross disciplinary teams can be a key component of data science.
Good data scientists are able to apply their skills to achieve many kinds of purposes. Their skills and competencies vary widely.</p>
